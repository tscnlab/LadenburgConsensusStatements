Light affects our sleep, mood, and health by influencing our bodyâ€™s internal clock, hormones and cognition. The Ladenburg Light and Health Consortium created clear, science-based statements to help explain why healthy light exposure matters. This information, targeted to public-health multipliers, is meant to support better communication for healthier light exposure for everyone.
