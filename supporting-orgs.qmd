The **[International Commission on Illumination](https://cie.co.at/)**, also known as the CIE from its French title, the Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage, is dedicated to global cooperation and the exchange of information on all matters related to the science and art of light and lighting, color and vision, light and radiation measurement, outdoor and indoor lighting design, photobiology, and image technology. The CIE is an independent scientific and international standards-developing organization that unites the lighting communities of its member countries to serve the world. CIE documents establish international consensus within its scope. In collaboration with the CIPM, the CIE maintains the international system of light measurement (photometry).

The **[Society for Light, Rhythms, and Circadian Health (SLRCH)](https://slrch.org/)** is an international scientific non-profit organization devoted to promoting research and knowledge about the effects of light on the organism and the chronobiology of psychiatric as well as other medical disorders. Founded in 1988 as the Society for Light Treatment in Biological Rhythms (SLTBR), the SLRCH has brought together leading scientific experts, clinicians, and interested participants from different professional and multi-disciplinary backgrounds for discussion and exchange on the science and practical application of chronotherapy in medicine. The SLRCH is helping the transition between molecular chronobiology and its clinical application in human health and medicine.

The **[Daylight Academy (DLA)](https://daylight.academy/)** is an international membership organisation initiated by the that brings together scientists, architects, engineers and other professionals involved in daylight research or with a strong interest in daylight related topics. By organising networking events, supporting interdisciplinary projects and providing a platform for connection and exchange among the different disciplines and fields of expertise working on daylight, the Academy wants to initiate cooperation, innovation and new knowledge. Such interdisciplinary exchange has the potential to be a catalyst for creativity, novelty and development. The aim is to strengthen daylight research and its applications for the benefit of humanity and nature.

The **[Good Light Group](https://www.goodlightgroup.org/)** is a global, nonprofit organisation dedicated to promoting the use of good light. "Good light" is defined as the right light at the right time, offering beneficial effects on the human body and brain. The foundation seeks to achieve this goal by raising awareness of light's impact on both vision and health, fostering global collaboration among scientists, lighting designers, companies, and organisations, and advancing knowledge development. The Good Light Group organizes webinars, creates animations, shares insights through blogs on social media, and produces guides and flyers for both the general public and professionals. The group is made up of participants, science advisors, and partners.

Founded in 1994, the **[Center for Environmental Therapeutics (CET)](https://cet.org/)** is a nonprofit organization dedicated to education and research on new environmental therapies that focus on scientifically validated approaches to optimizing mood, sleep, and performance, mainly through light therapy, chronotherapy, and other non-pharmacological treatments. The organization seeks to achieve this goal by raising awareness about how light exposure, sleep timing, and behavioral interventions can improve mental health and well-being, fostering collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and the public, and promoting evidence-based solutions. CET provides educational resources, shares insights through articles and social media, and offers practical tools for individuals and healthcare professionals.
