Short wavelengths appear violet, while longer wavelengths appear indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.\n\n### References\n\nCIE. (2020). ILV: International Lighting Vocabulary.

Depending on location, the amount of light in the day varies greatly between summer and winter.\n\n### References\n\nWebler, F. S., Spitschan, M., Foster, R. G., Andersen, M., & Peirson, S. N.

This power is called intensity. Physicists measure intensity, while biological and psychological scientists study how intensity affects various processes.\n\n### References\n\nCIE. (2014).

Changes in the time of day and weather conditions shift the wavelength composition. This shift changes the colour that daylight appears.\n\n### References\n\nBoyce, P. R. (2014).

Different materials cause the intensity of light to spread across different wavelengths in different ways. This spread of light across wavelengths is known as spectral distribution.\n\n### References\n\nPattison, P. M., Tsao, J. Y., Brainard, G. C., & Bugbee, B. (2018).

When exposed to bright light, melanopsin is activated, prompting ipRGCs to transmit signals to the brain. This activation triggers a neuronal pathway, blocking the production of melatonin in the pineal gland.\n\n### References\n\nBrown, T. M. (2020).
