    "text": "Anna Wirz-Justice PhD\nProfessor Emerita, Centre for Chronobiology, UPK Basel, Switzerland\nFor centuries, we thought we understood how the human eye works — until a surprising discovery in the 1990s changed everything. The clue came from a domain quite different from ophthalmology, the medical discipline specialised in the eye. In a strain of mice lacking rod or cone photoreceptors (the retinal cells responsible for colour and light sensitivity), exposure to light affected their behavioural circadian rhythms. The biological clock in these mice was still synchronised by light to the 24-hour day-night cycle even though they were blind with respect to vision. Could there be a third, undiscovered type of photoreceptor present in the retina? The next chapter in this quest was when the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) were revealed to be the mysterious photoreceptors. Together with rod and cone inputs, they signal a wide range of light levels in the environment, from the dim glow of starlight to the brightness of the midday sun. Their photopigment is melanopsin, with peak sensitivity in the short-wavelength part of the spectrum. Nerve pathways from the ipRGCs to the brain are amazingly diverse, showing that light plays an important role in regulating hormone secretion, sleep regulation, rhythms in body temperature, cognition, mood and alertness, and circadian and seasonal timing.\nThat is the basic science. Only recognised around two decades ago, these ipRGCs have enormously changed our understanding of the importance of light for health and well-being. But even before scientists uncovered this mechanism, bright light was already being used to treat depressive mood in people with seasonal affective disorder.\nNot surprisingly, the discovery of the ipRGCs introduced a new dimension for crafting and optimising light in the built environment: not only to maximise visual functions and minimise energy use, but also to maintain simultaneous input to the ipRGCs at the right level at the right time. It completely changed the field, leading to the development and publication of a melanopsin-based standard metrology system for quantifying the effects of light on humans by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 2018.\nLight and lighting have become a public health issue, and everyone should know about these remarkable findings. Simply paying attention to one’s personal light exposure — getting outside in the morning and dimming screens before bed — can make a big difference in how we feel and sleep."

    "text": "Background\nOver the past 50 years, the knowledge of how light affects humans has changed dramatically. In addition to enabling us to perform visual tasks, navigate in the environment, and appreciate the detailed, colourful and moving visual world, light is also fundamental to our biology. The light-dark cycle synchronises our body and brain to the external world, affects the production of hormones like melatonin, and can make us more alert.\nDiscoveries in neurobiology identified that a special type of cell in the human eye is responsible for these circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral effects of light. These cells, called the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), complement the visual information captured by rods and cones. They are also different from rods and cones in the way they respond to light and have maximal sensitivity to a different part of the wavelengths underlying white light.\nThe characterisation of these effects of light on humans and discovery of the ipRGCs catalyzed the development of novel standards for characterising light and lighting for humans, and how they should be applied. In 2018, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) published the International Standard CIE S 026/E:2018. In 2022, a group of international experts published consensus recommendations on the amount of light that humans should be exposed to for optimal health. Then, in 2024, the Ladenburg Roundtable “Light for health and well-being – from the biological principles to policy” was convened to discuss the application of the current knowledge to the real world – and how this translation can be supported.\nThis consensus document represents the coordinated effort to develop a series of core statements representing the best current scientific knowledge on the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral effects of light. Emerging from a White Paper developed at the Ladenburg Roundtable, this document outlines key principles for effective science and health communication. The statements form a kernel around which to build science and health communication campaigns.\nIt is well-known and appreciated that the translation of knowledge generated from basic research suffers a time lag from research to practice. This document is designed to accelerate the process – and make the wealth of scientific discoveries accessible to a wider audience.\n\n\nScope\nThe scope of this consensus document is on the circadian, neuroendocrine, and neurobehavioral effects of visible light mediated by the eye in humans.\n\n\nTarget audience\nThis consensus document is designed to inform a diverse range of stakeholders and multipliers who play a role in understanding, communicating, and applying knowledge about the non-visual effects of light, and who are multipliers of this knowledge. This includes public health professionals, health communication professionals, lighting industry professionals, healthcare professionals, policymakers and researchers. It is not designed to provide a definitive guide for the general public, but to support the development of public-facing messaging.\n\n\nConsensus process\nA core group of experts (authors MS, LK, OS, MG, JAV, RL) led the initial development of core statements. These were then put to consensus approval by the Ladenburg Light & Health Consortium, using 75% as an approval criterion. Feedback for each statement was given and incorporated. The simplified statements and contextual information were developed once the core statements were defined, and again feedback was invited. The consensus process took place between October 2024 and February 2025.\n\n\nStructure of this document\nThere are 26 consensus statements approved by the entirety of Ladenburg Consortium. Each statement is supported by a simplified statement, as well as contextual information and references. In the choice of references, reviews and illustrative research articles were prioritized, and the reference is list is not to be thought of as exhaustive.\n\n\nConsiderations for effective communication\nTo ensure purposeful and effective communication for any campaigns built on the consensus statements, multipliers should begin by clearly defining the target audience to ensure that the messaging is relevant, accessible and actionable. Language should be clear and jargon-free to reach a broad audience. Special attention should be given to reaching vulnerable and less accessible populations, including individuals with limited health literacy."

    "text": "The International Commission on Illumination, also known as the CIE from its French title, the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage, is dedicated to global cooperation and the exchange of information on all matters related to the science and art of light and lighting, color and vision, light and radiation measurement, outdoor and indoor lighting design, photobiology, and image technology. The CIE is an independent scientific and international standards-developing organization that unites the lighting communities of its member countries to serve the world. CIE documents establish international consensus within its scope. In collaboration with the CIPM, the CIE maintains the international system of light measurement (photometry).\n\nThe Society for Light, Rhythms, and Circadian Health (SLRCH) is an international scientific non-profit organization devoted to promoting research and knowledge about the effects of light on the organism and the chronobiology of psychiatric as well as other medical disorders. Founded in 1988 as the Society for Light Treatment in Biological Rhythms (SLTBR), the SLRCH has brought together leading scientific experts, clinicians, and interested participants from different professional and multi-disciplinary backgrounds for discussion and exchange on the science and practical application of chronotherapy in medicine. The SLRCH is helping the transition between molecular chronobiology and its clinical application in human health and medicine.\n\nThe Daylight Academy (DLA) is an international membership organisation initiated by the that brings together scientists, architects, engineers and other professionals involved in daylight research or with a strong interest in daylight related topics. By organising networking events, supporting interdisciplinary projects and providing a platform for connection and exchange among the different disciplines and fields of expertise working on daylight, the Academy wants to initiate cooperation, innovation and new knowledge. Such interdisciplinary exchange has the potential to be a catalyst for creativity, novelty and development. The aim is to strengthen daylight research and its applications for the benefit of humanity and nature.\n\nThe Good Light Group (GLG) is a global, nonprofit organisation dedicated to promoting the use of good light. “Good light” is defined as the right light at the right time, offering beneficial effects on the human body and brain. The foundation seeks to achieve this goal by raising awareness of light’s impact on both vision and health, fostering global collaboration among scientists, lighting designers, companies, and organisations, and advancing knowledge development. The Good Light Group organizes webinars, creates animations, shares insights through blogs on social media, and produces guides and flyers for both the general public and professionals. The group is made up of participants, science advisors, and partners.\n\nFounded in 1994, the Center for Environmental Therapeutics (CET) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to education and research on new environmental therapies that focus on scientifically validated approaches to optimizing mood, sleep, and performance, mainly through light therapy, chronotherapy, and other non-pharmacological treatments. The organization seeks to achieve this goal by raising awareness about how light exposure, sleep timing, and behavioral interventions can improve mental health and well-being, fostering collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and the public, and promoting evidence-based solutions. CET provides educational resources, shares insights through articles and social media, and offers practical tools for individuals and healthcare professionals."

Creative Commons\ndisclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the\nfullest extent possible.\n\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\n\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and\nconditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share\noriginal works of authorship and other material subject to copyright\nand certain other rights specified in the public license below. The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations\n     for the public:\n    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree\nto be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.
